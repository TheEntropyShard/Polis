## 🍕 About

This is my personal gemini capsule. It was launched on August 7, 2019, making it the 5th gemini server in existence!

Some of my interests include:

* internet history (technologies, design, subcultures, etc.)
* restoring ancient software
* building little applications and games, ie. vignettes
* creating art and music (quite poorly)

I also run a gopher server with some cool stuff on it.

## ✈️ Flight Journals

A "flight journal" was an early name for gemini logs before "gemlog" came about.

My main gemlog, which mostly contains either software related or meta-commentary about gemini.

This was my first attempt to add original content to gemini, back when there were only a handful of capsules around.

## 🎸 Gemini Software

Most of my software is written in python and hosted on Github 😈.

The server powering this capsule and (dozens?) of other capsules across gemini. All of the good ones, at least.
=>https://github.com/michael-lazar/jetforce jetforce - gemini server & framework

An extensive tool that I built to crawl and archive all of geminispace.
=>https://github.com/michael-lazar/mozz-archiver mozz-archiver - gemini crawler and archival tool

A script that will tell you how bad of a programmer you are.
=>https://github.com/michael-lazar/gemini-diagnostics gemini-diagnostics - diagnostic tool for gemini servers

A gopher server from the 2000's that I've been porting to python 3. Along the way, I also added support for gemini://.

The source code for the astrobotany server. A great resource if you want to learn how to cheat at the game.

My proposal for a markdown dialect for "text/gemini", from the dark days when text/gemini was hard-wrapped and "=>" was the only line type (oh my!). Some of these ideas made it into the current gemtext spec. I still maintain that "---" horizontal line break would have been a worthwhile addition.
